<h1>In seat facing Lanka, highlight is OPS’s fight, not Sethusamudram or Katchatheevu</h1>
   
 
  <p>
    LOCATED deep in southern Tamil Nadu, a state where it is just beginning to make an impact, Ramanathapuram has long been on the BJP’s radar.

    Under the UPA government at the Centre, it waged a battle against the Sethusamudram project to create a shipping route between India and Sri Lanka, whose one end would have touched Ramanathapuram, claiming it would destroy the bridge Lord Ram’s army made as per the Ramayana.
    
    Last year, a buzz began that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose government has been making extensive outreach to Tamils, would contest from Ramanathapuram.
 </p>
   
<p>Recalling the Dhanteras tradition in her family, the 31-year-old shares, “No matter what, we always buy a piece of gold or jewellery, whatever is in our capacity. I really look forward to it. That’s because I don’t personally love wearing jewellery as I wear so much in my day to day life for shoots. But I make sure that I get something custom-made for my mom, be it a nose pin or a ring. Something has to be there”.</p>



   
 
  <p>
    Once the Lok Sabha poll battle began, the BJP rolled out yet another dice – accusing the Indira Gandhi-led Congress government of giving away Katchatheevu island located 33 km off the Ramanathapuram coast, and the ruling DMK (which was also in power in the state then) of being complicit in the decision. </p>
